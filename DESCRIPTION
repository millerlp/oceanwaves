Description: Calculate ocean wave height summary statistics and process data 
    from bottom-mounted pressure sensor data loggers. Derived primarily from 
    MATLAB functions provided by U. Neumeier at 
    <http://neumeier.perso.ch/matlab/waves.html>. Wave number 
    calculation based on the algorithm in Hunt, J. N. (1979, ISSN:0148-9895)
